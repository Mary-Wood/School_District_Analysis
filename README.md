# School_District_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze data for a school district to determine key data such as general school district summary, in-depth school summary, top five and bottom five performing schools, average math and reading scores for each grade level at each school, student scores by school spending per student, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

# Results
In this challenge data, the scores for reading and math of 9th grade students at Thomas High School were removed and the base analyses were re-conducted. 

## Effect on District Summary
Removing the ninth grade students at Thomas High School did slightly impact all of the data. This change lead to a slightly differing numbers, most dramatically those in the % overall passing from 65.2% to 64.9%. ![original District Summary](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Original_District_Summary.png) ![challenge District Summary](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Challenge_District_Summary.png)

When removing the 9th graders scores from Thomas High School, scores decreased, taking the school from a overall passing percentage of 90.9% originally to 65.1%. ![original School Summary](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Original_School_Summary.png) ![challenge School Summary](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Challenge_School_Summary.png).
