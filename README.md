# School_District_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze data for a school district to determine key data such as general school district summary, in-depth school summary, top five and bottom five performing schools, average math and reading scores for each grade level at each school, student scores by school spending per student, scores by school size, and scores by school type. 

# Results
In this challenge data, the scores for reading and math of 9th grade students at Thomas High School were removed and the base analyses were re-conducted.

## Effect on District Summary
Removing the ninth grade students at Thomas High School did slightly impact all of the data. This change lead to a slightly differing numbers, most dramatically those in the % overall passing from 65.2% to 64.9%.

## Effect of School Summary
A similar effect was found on the school summary. When removing the 9th graders scores from Thomas High School, scores decreased, taking the school from a overall passing percentage of 90.9% originally to 90.6%.

## Effect on Thomas High School's performance
The effect on Thomas High School's performance was small. While Thomas remained in the second highest place in the top 5 of both the original and the challenge data set, their overall score was slightly decreased.

## Impact on other factors
* Math and reading scores by grade
The only changes to this aspect are those in the specific category of Thomas High School's 9th grade students. All the other values are the same. 
* Scores by school spending, school size, and school type
Interestingly, these data points did not change due to the removal of the 9th grade class. That is probably due to the fact that the data appeared to remain somewhat consistent over the grades in the Thomas High School. Additionally, the 9th grade students were still counted, even if their grades were removed. Images have been added to the Images folder to show the data for all of these aspects in the Images folder.

# Summary
Removing the 9th grade students from Thomas High School did not appear to change the data in any large or impactful way. Both the challenge and the original data sources show very similar (if not identical) trends. As such, it appears that school trends remain rather consistent over the grades within an individual school, showing that the success of a school may not be determined solely by one grade, but rather the larger trends within the entirety of the data.
